• 1.0.2 Added fields for Website & Register URLs.
• 1.0.3 Added buttons for viewing website URLs.
• 1.0.4 Changed launching code to use ShellExecute rather than just Shell and made it so you can pick between Launcher.exe and WoW.exe.

• 1.0.6 ???
• 1.0.7 ???
• 1.0.8 ???
• 1.0.9 Fixed a crash when you tried to add a server with just a name or address by making it so a blank name is automatically set to a server address and an empty server address results in error.
• 1.0.10 Added support for Lich King by updating the new realmlist file.
• 1.0.11 God i'm an idiot, fixed a typo that completely broke the launcher.
• 1.0.12 Added XFire support to the launcher so you can track hours and have in-game working (via SysInterals junction.exe)
• 1.0.13 Launcher.exe support removed from custom servers (don't want it updating your WoW anyway), now only affects launching official WoW.
• 1.0.14 Automatic removal of junction is gone for now as XFire will forget where your game is if it can't find the folder anymore.
• 1.0.15 Fixed issue of fake WoW path overwriting your real one (hopefully!).
