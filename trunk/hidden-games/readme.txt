             [ History ]
 I created this program on Saturday, 23 July 2005
 during High School Year 9.

 The purpose of this program is to hide all the windows
 listed in it with a simple key press and bring them back
 with another.

 This allows you to hide all your games / unauthorized
 applications from any passer by (Teacher or Student).

 I made this program in one day and I think I did some minor
 fixes to it but there was a problem with it being too slow
 when you added a lot of entires to the list, this is because
 I made it loop through the list every time you pressed hide
 or show. Obviously this reduced the usefulness as you could
 only list a few applications (about 10 or so) but it was still
 usable and got me through my classes undetected :D

 It is now 2008 and I was thinking about this program last night
 for some unknown reason and I have updated the code so it will
 only loop the list when you update it and store all the application
 names inside an array. This means that the program is much much
 faster. The size of the array is 999 which means you are limited
 to 999 entires in games.txt but this should be more than enough.
 
 Another feature I have added to the application is that if you
 want a program to be minimized before it is hidden you can put
 a ^ mark in front of the program name, Example: ^CloneDVD2
 
 A feature I have been wanting to support yet have been lazy about
 is matching wildcards in the title name. I'm not sure if support
 for this will ever be added as I'll have to do about 30 mins of work
 to support this and I don't think people even use my application.
 
 Anyhow, Enjoy!
