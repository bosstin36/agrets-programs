Title: Global VB Hotkey Control (v2)
Description: Allows hotkey activation of your application.
- Drop the control on a form, set the key (and shift/alt etc) to look out for and whenever that key is pressed your application will get a "HotkeyPressed" event - to do with as you please.
Version 2 allows multiple hotkey controls on one VB form.
